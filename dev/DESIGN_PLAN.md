# Design Review for Topology Optimization Software

## Project Requirements
1. **3D Model Loading and Visualization**
   - Load and display STL files.
   - Toggle visibility of STL, mesh, and nodes.
   
2. **Mesh Generation**
   - Support Delaunay, Voronoi, and Tetrahedral mesh generation.
   - Implement voxel mesh generation.

3. **User Interface**
   - Simple and intuitive GUI with menus and toolbar.
   - Options for mesh settings, material properties, and load properties.

4. **Renderer Enhancements**
   - Wireframe and solid surface rendering.
   - Node visualization with configurable properties.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Advanced error handling for mesh generation.
   - Detailed logging for debugging and user feedback.

6. **Performance and Usability**
   - Optimize performance for large models.
   - Ensure smooth interaction and real-time rendering.

## Design Considerations
1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate modules for GUI, renderer, mesh generation, and utilities.

2. **Scalability**
